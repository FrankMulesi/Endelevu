                Buildings and construction have major impacts on our environment in its resource use (land, materials,
                energy, water); emissions (GHG, particulates, waste) and on biodiversity. The construction industry
                accounts for one third of all the waste and GHG emissions created,
                and more than a third of all the material used globally.
                These sectors can also play a critical role in improving
                the environment by cleaning polluted areas and recycling
                not only its own waste streams but those of other sectors
                in its own production and consumption. On the other hand,
                buildings contribute to human health, safety and comfort.
                Construction activities provide employment and innovation
                opportunities for both genders and to the youth. Thus,
                sustainable building construction provides an excellent
                platform for contributing to sustainable consumption and
                production, climate change mitigation and realization of
                other Sustainable Development Goals.
                Endelevu® Design Challenge is calling for young built environment professionals (future architects,
                designers, engineers, etc) to craft and innovate new materials and uses from waste and co-create healthy
                spaces.

                The higher education sub-sector continues to face a number of
                 quality and relevance issues that are of concern. One of the challenges
                  facing University and TVET 
                education in Kenya is the mismatch between the skills graduate acquire 
                and demands from the industry. Tertiary education institutions are often 
                blamed for producing graduates who are not adequately equipped and empowered 
                to tackle the challenges of our time. There is a general lack of ‘practical’ 
                and ‘challenging’ on the ground practice, as most of the curricula is heavily 
                theory based. Certification is often based on completion of courses and passing
                 examinations rather than demonstration of competence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly, there is a general absence of integrated sustainability in the student’s curricula, as well as within the University’s internal policies and procedures ranging from procurement to facilities and operations.
                Obviously, architectural education needs a re-set,
              </p>
              <p>
                 to make it fit for the future. New structures and value systems are needed. Architectural education for the future should instill in the learners an awareness of the agency of the architect to affect change, urgently; it should equip them with the skills of critical and system thinking; and enhance their collaborative capacity.  This requires taking the studio
                 out of the school and making apprenticeship and craftsmanship commonplace. 
                </p>
              </p>
                 Endelevu® Design Challenge will demonstrate an interactive learning model and program which will not only lead to innovation and creativity, but also addresses the needs of the community. Through the Challenge, students and graduates collaboratively extend theoretical design principles into real-life design-build projects in order to create inclusive,  resource efficient, and
                  economically viable structural solutions for human shelter.

              <p>
                There is huge disparities in access to quality social infrastructure in Kenya and the rest of Africa. For example, in Kenya, the tuition, sanitation and accommodation facilities in most schools are inadequate, incomplete or dilapidated. About 38% of Kenyan primary schools either do not have toilet and water facilities or have large enrollment without adequate functional toilets and water facilities. 43.9% of the schools do not have libraries.  41% of public schools are not fenced and are therefore at an immediate risk of encroachment. The current state of the physical infrastructure in many schools is also not friendly for the children with disabilities. Hence, a majority of out-of-school children in Kenya have a disability, with 16% of all children and young people with disability being out of education. These shortages and disparities will greatly hinder the full implementation of the new Competency Based Curriculum (CBC) system and realization of the Universal Basic Education targets.

                Creating healthy and safe childcare environments to support the growth and needs of our young population and working/studying mothers is also one of the greatest challenge facing the design industry today. Globally, the World Bank estimates that 350 million children do not have access to child care services. Each year, about 1 million children are born in Kenya. Despite the growing demand for systems to care for children, so that their mothers and other family members can work and support their families, Kenya has a very weak childcare support system and COVID has stretched this system to a breaking point. 52% of working Kenyan women resume work within three months after birth contributing to a rapid decrease in breastfeeding rates - hence the need to create conducive work environment for women to successfully combine work with breastfeeding. The need for childcare facilities for adolescent and teenage mothers is dire. According to a 2016 survey by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Kenya recorded 378,397 adolescent and teenage pregnancies for girls aged 10-19 years between July 2016 and June 2017, specifically, 28,932 girls aged 10-14 and 349,465 girls aged 15-19 became pregnant. The Kenya Demographic Health Survey (KDHS) 2014 found that 13,000 teenage girls drop out of Kenyan schools every year due to pregnancy.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Endelevu® Design Challenge provides a long-term and well coordinated collaborative programme to support the government’s efforts in addressing these social infrastructure gaps. Endelevu.Africa supports socially-inclusive and circular construction programs that help communities to create, develop, and support healthy spaces through material reuse and corporate social responsibility.
